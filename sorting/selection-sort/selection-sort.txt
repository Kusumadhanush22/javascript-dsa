Consider the following the [4,1,3,2,5]

here selection sort the selection the minimum number inside an array and swaps it with the current index 

Algo:

for i = 0 to n-1:
    let lowest = i
    for j = i+1 to n:
        if (a[j] < a[lowest])
            lowest = j
    if(i ! === lowest) 
        swap(a[i], a[lowest])
