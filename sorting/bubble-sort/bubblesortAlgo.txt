consider following array 2,3,1,4,5,6

bubble sort makes sure the largest element in the end. Here the outer loop is used (i) is used to traverse the array.
every time j and j+1 is compared if (j)th element is greater than (j+1) then swap else do nothing

Pattern

let i =0 , j =0
2 3 1 4 5 6 since 2 is not greater than 3 nothing will happen.

let i=0 , j =1
2 1 3 4 5 6 since 3 greter than 1 it swaps as per logic

let i=0, j =2
2 1 3 4 5 6 since 3 is not greater than 4 nothing will happen.

let i=0, j=3
2 1 3 4 5 6 since 4 is not greater than 5 nothing will happen.

let i=0, j=4
2 1 3 4 5 6 since 5 is not greater than 6 nothing will happen.

let i=1, j=0
1 2 3 4 5 6 since 2 greter than 1 it swaps as per logic

let i=1, j=1
1 2 3 4 5 6 since 2 is not greater than 3 nothing will happen.

ALGORITHM:

for i = 0 to n:
    for j =0 to n-1:
        if a[j] > a[j+!] swap(a[j], a[j+1])

Optimized solution
for i = 0 to n:
    for j =0 to n-i-1:
        if a[j] > a[j+!] swap(a[j], a[j+1])

Optimized solution:
for i = 0 to n:
    let flag = true
    for j =0 to n-i-1:
        if a[j] > a[j+!] {
            swap(a[j], a[j+1])
            flag = false
        } 
    if(flag) break;
